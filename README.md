## About The Project

ðŸš€ Welcome to the Guess My Number Game! Test your luck and see if you can guess the secret number correctly.

âœ¨ This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript and DOM manipulation to create an interactive and fun game.

## How To Play

ðŸ”¢ The computer selects a secret number between 1 and 20. Your task is to guess the correct number.

ðŸ’¡ After each guess, you'll receive a hint whether your guess is too high or too low.

ðŸŽ‰ If you guess the correct number, you win! Your highscore will be updated if you beat the previous one.

ðŸ”ƒ If you want to play again, simply hit the "Play Again" button to reset the game.
